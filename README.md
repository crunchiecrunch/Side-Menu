# Side-Menu

Notes:

- Speed of pan seems inconsistant with finger
- Can adjust ratio of screen covered by presented view within SlideInPresentationController
- Speed of presentation seems to differ if you swipe it out as opposed to tapping the button, and setting the speed for one directly affects the other
- Using UIScreenEdgePanGestureRecognizer for swiping the presented view away proved difficult so its not being used like it is for the Main view
